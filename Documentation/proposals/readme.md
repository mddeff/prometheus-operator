# Prometheus-Operator proposals

This section is used to document proposals that the prometheus-operator team feels go beyond the scope of a simple GitHub issue.

## Quickstart
1. Fork this repository and clone your forked repository
2. Run `new.sh` from this directory with a new proposal number and title as arguments:
   ```bash
   ./new.sh 0005 awesome-new-feature
   ```
3. Fill out the information block at the top of the readme, with 'reserved' as the status.
4. Commit/push and make a pull request to this repository
5. Create a pull request merging your forked repository (with the branch) into `prometheus-operator:main`
   - Set the title of the pull request to "Reserving Proposal 0001" (replacing 0001 with your proposal number)
6. Now that you have a reserved proposal number, see [How to write a proposal](#how-to-write-a-proposal) below

## How to write a proposal
